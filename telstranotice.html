<h2>We&rsquo;re switching off 3G from 30 June 2024</h2>

<p>The demand for mobile services continues to increase, so we&rsquo;re taking steps to reduce congestion, increase capacity and improve coverage.</p>

<p>For that to happen, we&rsquo;re removing our oldest mobile technology - 3G - and repurposing it to expand our faster 5G network.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What does closure of the 3G network mean for me?</h2>

<p>If you have a device that&rsquo;s only able to connect to 3G, you won&rsquo;t be able to connect to Telstra&rsquo;s network after 30 June 2024.</p>

<p>If your mobile device doesn&rsquo;t have Voice over LTE (VoLTE) technology, even if it uses 4G, it will not be able to make voice calls on our network after 30 June 2024.</p>

<p>If your device doesn&rsquo;t support VoLTE emergency calling, you will not be able to make an emergency call to 000 on the Telstra Mobile Network.</p>

<p>To continue using our network, you&rsquo;ll need to upgrade to a 4G/5G VoLTE-capable and compatible device before 30 June 2024. That will ensure you can access Telstra&rsquo;s network and will have both data access and voice calling.</p>

<p>Customers using 3G mobile, IoT and network extension devices, some EFTPOS machines, medical devices and antennas that operate on the 3G network only will be able to continue using their device or antenna until 30 June 2024. After this date, if the device has not been updated to be 4G or 5G compatible, it will no longer work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What are we doing to help?</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re building out our 4G coverage, so that where you can get 3G today, you&rsquo;ll be able to get 4G.</p>

<p>We may have already contacted you about the closure. We&rsquo;ll be in touch with affected customers again through November, March and May.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll let you know about devices that need upgrading, including mobile phones, tablets and laptops, smart watches and wearables, Mobile Broadband modems, Internet of Things and M2M devices, repeaters and smart antennas, medical alert devices and NextG Wireless Link devices &ndash; anything that only connects to the Telstra mobile network through 3G.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What can you do now?</h2>

<p>We want you to be prepared well ahead of time. Here&rsquo;s how you can do that:</p>

<h3>Check if your device shows 4G or 5G</h3>

<p>An easy way to check if your device is compatible is to look for &lsquo;4G&rsquo; or &lsquo;5G&rsquo; on the screen. If it only says &lsquo;3G&rsquo; now or when you make a voice call, you probably need to replace it to stay connected.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Check your device settings</h3>

<p>Check your device network is set to &lsquo;automatic&rsquo;. If it isn&rsquo;t, follow the steps below to update it:</p>

<h4>Apple devices</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong></li>
	<li>Go to <strong>Mobile</strong></li>
	<li>Go to <strong>Mobile Data options</strong></li>
	<li>Go to <strong>Voice and Data</strong></li>
	<li>Select <strong>automatic</strong>. If automatic isn&rsquo;t an option, select <strong>4G</strong>.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

	&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h3>Recycle your old device</h3>

<p>There are several options available to help you recycle old mobiles, chargers, and accessories.</p>
