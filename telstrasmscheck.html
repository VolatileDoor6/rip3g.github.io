<h1><strong>Telstra SMS Checking Service:</strong></h1>
<p>Telstra has launched a service where you can check to see if your phone will work after the shutdown date of 3G on the Telstra Mobile Network. However, I have tested it with three phones and it's a bit hit-and-miss. If you're a Telstra customer, you can use this by texting ‘3’ to 3498. However, you can also check this by looking to see if you have the little ‘VoLTE’ icon on Android, or place a call and see if it drops to 3G from 4G on either iPhone or Android.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phones I've tested this on so far is as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Nokia E71 - 3G only (Said it couldn't determine if it would work or not)</li>
    <li>Samsung S23 Ultra - 5G, 4G, 3G (Same thing as the E71)</li>
    <li>iPhone 12 mini - 5G, 4G, 3G (It couldn't identify the phone)</li>
</ol>
