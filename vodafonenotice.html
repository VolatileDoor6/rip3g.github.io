<h1 style="text-align:center">Our 3G network is closing down</h1>

<p>At Vodafone we are always working hard to bring you faster speeds and new features on our mobile network. Our 4G network now covers more than 24 million Australians and our state-of-the-art 5G network is stronger than ever. With superior speeds and greater connectivity available across these networks, we are now preparing to switch off our legacy 3G mobile network by the end of 2023.</p>

<p>This means if you&rsquo;re a Vodafone customer or business that uses 3G, it is time to upgrade to a new device that can work on 4G and 5G networks. Our priority is to keep our remaining 3G customers connected and help ensure they make a smooth transition to 4G or 5G prior to the December 2023 switch off date.</p>
