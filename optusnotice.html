<h3 style="text-align:left"><strong><span style="color:#000000">What&rsquo;s changing?</span></strong></h3>

<p style="text-align:left">3G technology was first launched 20 years ago at a time when we were still listening to music on CDs, the biggest social network was MySpace, and the Blackberry was the number 1 smartphone. So like with all great technologies, sometimes you need to say goodbye.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:left">From September 2024, we&#39;ll be repurposing our 3G technology to boost the capacity, speed and reliability of our 4G network and rollout 5G to even more Australians.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">For those interested, this standard practice is called re-farming when a specific mobile radio frequency band is repurposed from one technology to another.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Will I be affected?</strong></h3>

<p>From September 2024, 3G services will no longer be available on the Optus network. But don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re here to help you through this change.</p>

<p>1. Over 2023, we&#39;ll be reaching out to customers who we believe may have a device impacted by these changes.</p>

<p>2. If you receive an email, letter or message, we recommend checking your device manual or via the manufacturer&rsquo;s website or support team to confirm if the device is reliant on 3G. We&rsquo;ve provided more details on how to do this and the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.optus.com.au/support/mobiles-tablets-wearables/important-changes-3g#devices" style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">top 25 most-used 3G devices here</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;If your device relies on 3G, you&rsquo;ll need to upgrade your device to a 4G or 5G capable device to continue to stay connected. We&rsquo;ve provided options below on how to do this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong><span style="color:#000000">What to do before September 2024</span></strong></h3>

<p style="text-align:center">To ensure you remain connected and have optimal network coverage, you&rsquo;ll need to ensure that from September 2024:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">1. Your device supports 4G VoLTE (if your device is used for voice calls)</p>

<p style="text-align:center">2. Your device is compatible with 4G 700 MHz (B28) spectrum.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">If your device is not 4G or 5G capable, to continue to access the Optus network, you have a few options.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">(*5G available in select areas (ex NT) and on select plans. Check coverage availability at optus.com.au/5Gcoverage)</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>How will I know if I&#39;m impacted?</strong></h3>

<p>To check if your device will be affected, we recommend you refer to your device manual or contact the manufacturer via their website or by giving them a call.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In technical terms, you&rsquo;re looking to confirm:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If your device is reliant on 3G 900MHz spectrum for voice and/or data service</li>
	<li>If your device supports 4G VoLTE&nbsp;(including VoLTE Emergency calling)
	<ul>
		<li>If you&rsquo;re using your device to make and receive voice calls, then your device needs to support 4G VoLTE and have VoLTE enabled in your device settings from September 2024</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If your device is compatible with 4G 700 MHz (B28) spectrum
	<ul>
		<li>L700MHz is low band 4G spectrum used by Optus and some other providers for optimal 4G coverage.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span style="color:var(--color-black,'#000000')">Even recent device models that may have been purchased from other retailers or overseas may not be compatible with 4G 700MHz spectrum band and therefore, may also be impacted</span></p>
